## Installation

Before you install this plug-in you have to make sure that your Vim install has
the necessary components installed. To check run `vim --version`, then look for
`multi_byte` and `statusline`. If there is a `+` in front of both of them, then
you're good to go. 

To install any Vim plug-in you have a few options:

### 1. Put Files Into Root of the `.vim` Directory (Not Recommended)

Without a plug-in manger (like the ones below) you have to manually put each
file/folder (plugin/, doc/, autoload/, etc.) into the root of your .vim folder.
I highly recommend that you use one of the plug-in mangers below for less
manual work and easier organization.

## Configuration

There are 4 different "components" of Nyan Cat that you can change:

| `<component>` | Example  | Description                                 |
| -----------   | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `trail`       | `======` | The rainbow that Nyan Cat leaves behind him |
| `body`        | `[]`     | The poptart/body of Nyan Cat                |
| `head`        | `*`      | The face of Nyan Cat                        |
| `space`       | `------` | The empty space in front of Nyan Cat        |

You can change each component by using the following command where
<component> is the type of component from the list above and
<componentNum> is the option for the component (default 0) from the list
below:

	let g:catium#<component> = <componentNum>

then you are not loading Unicode correctly (should be fine in Vim).
